# My first to-do app
A simple to-do app featuring vanilla JS and some responsive styling with CSS.
This app provides the posibility to add tasks, mark them as complete as well as delete individual tasks.

I did also implement filtering through 3 categories however, there seems to be a slight bug there as the filtering does not perform as hoped for.
I have also found some sources on localStorage() which I would have liked to implement on the next project that perhaps requires a more in-depth skills.
